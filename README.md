# Ray_Caster
A tech demo of a ray caster with an Entity Component System written in C++ using SFML and OpenCV
It's my second "true" project in c++ (a language that is notorious for being hard to use) => The code is likely to be very bad :(
I let vcpkg deal with my libraries so you shall not find them here.
