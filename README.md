# Ray_Caster
A tech demo of a ray caster with an Entity Component System written in C++ using SFML
It's my second "true" project in c++ (a language that is notorious for being hard to use) => The code is likely to be very bad :(

To run :
cd build
cmake .. -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang
cmake --build .
