# Ray_Caster_abandoned
I was not organized enough nor did I plan my project well enough before starting.
I feel the need to do it all over again, learning from my mistakes to have a project w/ a better structure.
A tech demo of a ray caster with an Entity Component System written in C++ using SFML
It's my second "true" project in c++ (a language that is notorious for being hard to use) => The code is likely to be very bad :(
I let vcpkg deal with my libraries so you shall not find them here.
